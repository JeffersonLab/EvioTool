Changes from the previous version:

- in C code, add mutex protection when calling et_close and other routines
  so there is much more thread safety. It is necessary to run this version
  of ET (14.0) in order not to crash the emu with a JVM seg fault.
  
- in C code, after et_close() is called, its et id cannot be used,
  returns new error, ET_ERROR_CLOSED
  
- in C and Java, when broad/multicasting to connect to an ET system, an
  ET client will use all the IP addresses sent by the ET system to try and
  connect, starting with addresses on the same subnets. A timeout of 3 seconds
  maximum exists for each address tried.

- the "scons install" option now installs et_start and et_monitor but the examples
  must now be installed by doing "scons examples"

- add scons options:
    -- to remove documentation
    -- It now installs into $CODA unless --prefix given on cmd line.
       It can also install into --incdir, --bindir, and --libdir if
       more installation control is needed

- add ant options to:
    -- remove documentation
    -- install & uninstall jar files
    -- install into CODA env var or into --prefix
